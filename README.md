# sycl_points

A C++ header-only point cloud processing library accelerated with SYCL for heterogeneous computing systems.

## Overview

sycl_points provides efficient implementations of common point cloud processing operations using Intel's SYCL (Single-source heterogeneous programming for C++) standard. The library enables accelerated processing on various hardware architectures including CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators that support SYCL.

This project was developed with reference to small_gicp, a lightweight point cloud registration library.

Key features:
- Efficient point cloud data structures for CPU and accelerator memory
- K-nearest neighbor search using KD-trees
- Point cloud registration (ICP with GICP variant)
- Voxel downsampling for point cloud simplification
- Covariance estimation
- Point transformations (rotation, translation)
- PLY/PCD file format support


Future optimization work will include:
- Memory access pattern improvements
- Workgroup size tuning
- Algorithm refinements for better parallelization
- Specialized optimizations for different hardware targets

## Requirements
